## open_search_results_google_python

this simple sript will goole the arguments and open the top five search result.
  
**python quickgoogle.py hehe wahaha**
will google 'hehe wahaha' and open the top five results  
  
Also there are two argument to make the number of search results to open: **-t n and --top=n**. 
The options must be typed before the search keyword, otherwise the getopt will 
not be able to capture it.  

Also the **shebang line** only works on **linux**. No idea about how to do it on windows.
